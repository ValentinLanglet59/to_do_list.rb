[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

## Features

- Implementation of the CRUD

- Trained Ruby language

- Trained class 

- Trained MVC pattern

### Problems encountered

- Add to search for a router, in Rails it is not needed (already added in the framework)

- I find it harder to find a bug in back-end because there is no visual representation of the bug, you have to find it in the terminal/shell

- Added a fake database (Repository.rb) to store the tasks, in Rails it is not needed
